Due to the discussed limitations in section \ref{challenges}, we can derive two takeaways.
It is crucial that we continue to conduct more research to determine the accuracy of the refactored code produced by AI systems. This is not just a task for a few, but a collective effort that requires the expertise and dedication of all involved in the field of AI-assisted code refactoring.
Furthermore, it will be necessary to improve the communication between tools and developers and improve education about existing tools so software engineers can utilize them to their full potential.\\
Automated code refactoring is a familiar idea and shows accurate results. AI-assisted refactoring brings discoveries on when and, more importantly, why code has to be refactored. GPT models can already be used to great effect, properly refactoring found research opportunities. Random Forest models are great at discovering refactoring opportunities, especially when trained on specific datasets. As fully automated code refactoring is still faulty, more research has to be conducted to increase trustability and allow reliance on AI-assisted code refactoring.
