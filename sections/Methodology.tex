Through snowballing, we were able to find very influential pieces of research like Fowler's book on refactoring \cite{fowler2018refactoring}.
Through backward Snowballing, we were able to find helpful systematic literature reviews which helped in gaining a broader understanding of the research that has already been conducted \cite{mariani2017systematic} \cite{baqais2020automatic} \cite{7833023}.
Using this knowledge we were able to reach our conclusions as to which would be the next relevant steps to further this technology.
