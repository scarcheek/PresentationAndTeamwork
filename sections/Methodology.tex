Through snowballing, we found very influential pieces of research like Fowler's book on refactoring \cite{fowler2018refactoring}.
Through backward Snowballing, we were able to find helpful, systematic literature reviews, which helped in gaining a broader understanding of the research that has already been conducted \cite{mariani2017systematic} \cite{baqais2020automatic} \cite{7833023}.
Using this knowledge, we were able to reach our conclusions about the next relevant steps to further this technology.
