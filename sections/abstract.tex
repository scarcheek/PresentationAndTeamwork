    This Paper aims to shed light onto developments in AI Assisted/Automated Code refactoring, how it can help the indtustry and which models work most efficiently to tackle different challenges code refactoring brings. This will be done by going over various literature describing first the challenges at hand and afterwards discussing several possible solutions that have been tested to gain a greater understanding and to generate an informed outlook into further developments of this technology.
