    Refactoring is one of the most important parts of the software development process for any software engineer. It makes the program code more readable and less complex while keeping the structure and utilization of the targetted code the same.
    This paper aims to shed light on developments in AI-assisted/Automated Code refactoring, how it can help the industry and which models work most efficiently to tackle different challenges code refactoring brings. This paper will cover various literature describing the challenges at hand first and then discuss several possible solutions tested to gain a greater understanding and generate an informed outlook into further developments of this technology.
